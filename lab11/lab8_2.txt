a i) The UI is considered to be composable because the elements are
  modular and can be used in multiple contexts (i.e. the CommentBox
  can be used in another part of the web applicaton for the same purpose).

  ii) JSX is considered syntactic sugar in terms of element creation.
  Its main purpose it to make it easier to visualize the elements on a
  page than simply hard coding them with javascript. It gets compiled
  into javascript but is simpler to write.

  iii) Comments are loaded by using a GET request to obtain a JSON
  list of comments and then parsing the list into separate items.
  Comments are submitted by sending a POST request containing the
  field data. The comments are saved by writing them to a file in
  the filesystem.

  iv) Components accept props as arbitrary inputs and return React
  elements. For example, you can make a Hello _____ function with
  the _____ being an accepted input (prop) and return a html element
  containing the text. Props are immutable and are set at initialization.
  State is only seen on the inside of component definitions and is mutable.

b i) When a comment is added or removed from the comments.json file,
  it is immediately reflected on the client, since the page polls every
  2000ms as defined in example.js.

  ii)  Data is bound to the state, which automatically re-renders upon
  detecting a change.

  iii) If the state of a component isn't the same is the view, then the
  UI is not synchronized with the server's data.

  iv) If the server rejects the comment, then (worst case) it only appears
  on the client's screen for a split second.
